== Description ==
The usage is simple.

In your post, write LaTeX syntax encapsulated by [math] and [/math].

[math]{Latex Syntax}[/math].

For example, [math]x^2+y^2[/math]

It uses the Mathjax (https://www.mathjax.org) since the 2.0 version

== Upgrade Notice ==
I discard the mathtex way since
   1. John Forkosh does not maintain it anymore
   2. Installing mathtex in web hosting is not easy.

Instead, I chose Mathjax (https://www.mathjax.org) to use LATEX.

Therefore, the previous [math pre=<option>] is not working.

Now, it's only working with the "[math] [/math]" pair.
